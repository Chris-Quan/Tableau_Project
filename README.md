# Final-Project-Tableau

## Project/Goals
To analyze the FAA wildlife strike dataset to determine the cost of wildlife strikes


## Process
1. Analyze the given dataset (FAA Wildlife Strikes, 2015) to see the impact of wildlife Strikes
2. Build visualizations of key details
3. Find different patterns or trends relating to the impact of bird strikes
4. Setup a dashboard to quickly see key data

## Results
Key take away

1. Florida, Texas, California and New York are amongst the highest states for strikes
2. A state that has more strikes doesnâ€™t necessarily mean they incurred more cost.
Notably New York has suffered a lot more losses than another state with more destroyed aircrafts

2. Most strikes happen earlier into the day and afternoon with a dip at night but on average strikes at night are more costly than those that happen during the day
4. Strikes always happen year long but always peak in the summer times of August. Despite the increasing amount of yearly bird strikes, we can see that cost is still kept a minimum


## Challenges 
There were no signifcant challenges in this project

## Future Goals
Given more time I could have been more thorough with my analysis and answer my questions such as is the yearly increase of bird strikes due to more flights happening?

I would also like to come back and make my visuals more presentable
